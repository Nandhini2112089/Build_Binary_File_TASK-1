##  CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment)

---

###  **What is CI/CD?**

**CI – Continuous Integration**

* Developers frequently push code to a shared Git repository.
* Each push triggers **automated build, test, and validation** workflows.
* Ensures early bug detection, integration issues resolution, and stable builds.

**CD – Continuous Delivery/Deployment**

* **Continuous Delivery:** Automatically builds, tests, and prepares code for release; deployment is triggered manually.
* **Continuous Deployment:** Automatically pushes each successful change to production with **zero manual intervention**.

---

##  CI/CD Pipeline Stages & Tools

---

### **1. Code – Version Control Stage**

**Purpose:**

* Track changes, collaborate via branches, and trigger builds on code events.

**Tools:**

* GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

**Mechanism:**

* Push/PR triggers CI via webhooks (e.g., `.yml` workflows)

---

### **2. Build – Compile & Package**

**Purpose:**

* Convert source code into deployable artifacts (JAR, WAR, Docker image, etc.)

**Tools:**

* **Build Tools:** Maven, Gradle, Ant
* **Containerization:** Docker, Podman
* **Artifact Repositories:** Nexus, JFrog Artifactory, GitHub Packages

 **Mechanism:**

* Run `mvn clean install`, `docker build`
* Output: JAR/WAR or Docker images
* Stored in registries for deployment

---

### **3. Test – Automated Validation**

 **Purpose:**

* Verify code correctness, security, and performance.

 **Tools:**

* **Unit Testing:** JUnit, TestNG
* **UI Testing:** Selenium, Cypress
* **API Testing:** Postman, Newman, REST Assured
* **Security:** SonarQube, Snyk

**Mechanism:**

* CI runs `npm test`, `mvn test`, etc.
* Generate coverage reports
* Fail pipeline on errors

---

### **4. Continuous Integration – Core CI Automation**

**Purpose:**

* Automate build, test, and integration for every code change.

**Popular CI Tools:**

* **GitHub Actions:** YAML-based CI native to GitHub
* **Jenkins:** Customizable, plugin-rich CI server
* **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated with GitLab repos
* Others: CircleCI, Travis CI, TeamCity, Bamboo, Buildkite

**Mechanism:**

* Receives webhook from Git push/PR
* Executes `.yml` workflows
* Performs steps: build → test → lint → notify
* Sends alerts via Slack, MS Teams, email

---

### **5. Continuous Delivery / Deployment – CD Automation**

 **Purpose:**

* Automate artifact release to **staging or production** with approvals or automatically.

**CD Tools:**

* **GitOps-based:** ArgoCD, Flux
* **Pipeline-based:** Spinnaker, Jenkins, Harness, Octopus Deploy
* **Cloud-native:** AWS CodeDeploy, Azure Pipelines, Google Cloud Deploy

**Mechanism:**

* Pull artifacts from registries (e.g., DockerHub, ECR)
* Apply manifests (Helm, K8s YAML)
* Deployment Strategies:

  * Rolling updates
  * Canary releases
  * Blue/Green deployments
* Rollback on failures

---

### **6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

**Purpose:**

* Define, provision, and manage infrastructure via versioned code.

**Tools:**

* **Terraform:** Multi-cloud, declarative syntax (`.tf`)
* **Ansible:** SSH-based, playbook-driven
* Others: Puppet, Chef, SaltStack

**Mechanism:**

* Terraform: `terraform plan → apply`
* Ansible: `ansible-playbook site.yml`
* Store infra configs alongside application code

---

### **7. Containerization & Orchestration**

**Purpose:**

* Package apps into portable units (containers) and deploy at scale.

**Tools:**

* **Containers:** Docker, Podman
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s), OpenShift
* **K8s Package Manager:** Helm
* **Cluster Mgmt:** Rancher

**Mechanism:**

* Define app in `Dockerfile`
* Build: `docker build`, Push: `docker push`
* Deploy: `kubectl apply`, `helm install`
* Kubernetes handles service discovery, scaling, secrets

---

### **8. Monitoring & Logging**

**Purpose:**

* Ensure app reliability, observability, and traceability post-deployment.

**Monitoring Tools:**

* **Prometheus:** Metric collection
* **Grafana:** Visualization
* **Datadog**, **New Relic**, **Zabbix**, **Nagios**

**Logging Tools:**

* **ELK Stack:** Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
* **Loki**, **Fluentd**, **Splunk**, **Graylog**

**Mechanism:**

* Metrics/logs exported from services
* Alerts on failures, errors, CPU, memory
* Dashboards for system health

## CI/CD End-to-End Workflow

```plaintext
1. Developer pushes code ➝ Git webhook triggers CI
2. CI tool builds & tests code
3. Artifacts (e.g., Docker images) pushed to registry
4. CD tool fetches artifacts and deploys to environments
5. Monitoring & Logging tools track health & performance
6. Alerts/reporting on failures and threshold breaches
```
